# Sign Language Translator

This project aims to develop a two-way sign language translator that converts voice to sign language and vice versa in real-time. The objective is to bridge the communication gap between the hearing impaired community and the hearing community.

## Motivation

With nearly 360 million people having a disabling hearing loss, there is a growing need for effective communication tools for the deaf and dumb community. Sign language is the primary method of communication for people in the deaf community, but it is not widely understood by the majority of hearing people. This project aims to address this issue by developing a sign language translator that enables two-way communication.

## Features

- Real-time conversion of voice to sign language and vice versa
- Processing of video frames using the OpenCV Library in Python
- Background subtraction using the Gaussian Mixture-based Background/Foreground Segmentation Algorithm
- Integration of deep learning techniques for hand gesture recognition

## Implementation

The project utilizes AI techniques and Python frameworks such as OpenCV and TensorFlow to reduce hardware costs. It captures hand signs from a webcam using an artificial intelligence model and classifies them to generate the corresponding word or sign. The system can also convert voice into sign language using Python sound and OpenCV frameworks, enabling two-way communication.

## Limitations

- Only a specific number of hand gestures can be trained
- Classification may be slow

## Getting Started

To get started with the Sign Language Translator project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Ajayprakashk7/AI-based-Two-Way-Sign-Language-System`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the main script: `python mic.py` for voice to sign and text
4. Run the main script: `python final.py` for sign to voice and text
